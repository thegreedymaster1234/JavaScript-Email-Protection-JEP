# 🛡️ JavaScript Email Protection (JEP) Repository

## Description
Welcome to the **JavaScript Email Protection (JEP)** repository! 📧 This project offers a simple and lightweight way to keep your email safe from spam bots. Instead of leaving your email exposed in plain HTML (where bots can easily grab it), this script dynamically inserts it using JavaScript—making it way harder for scrapers to detect.
